## **Setup Instructions**

### **Backend**

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   \`\`\`bash
   cd backend
   \`\`\`
2. Start the development server:
   \`\`\`bash
   yarn dev
   \`\`\`
3. The server will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### **Frontend**

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   \`\`\`bash
   cd frontend
   \`\`\`
2. Start the frontend development server:
   \`\`\`bash
   yarn dev
   \`\`\`
3. The app will be running at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

## **Technical Decisions Analysis**

### **Backend: Serverless + AWS + DynamoDB**

#### **Pros:**

1. **Scalability**:  
   Serverless architectures automatically scale with traffic. AWS Lambda functions, for example, scale as needed, which reduces the need for manual provisioning of servers.
2. **Cost Efficiency**:  
   You only pay for what you use. Serverless computing typically has lower upfront costs since you're billed based on the actual execution time and resources used, which is ideal for variable workloads.
3. **Reduced Infrastructure Management**:  
   Since AWS manages the infrastructure, it reduces the complexity of maintaining and provisioning servers, patches, and scaling concerns. This allows developers to focus more on the application logic.
4. **Event-Driven Architecture**:  
   Serverless architectures fit well with event-driven systems. AWS services like S3, DynamoDB, and SNS can trigger Lambda functions, streamlining workflows.
5. **Flexibility**:  
   The ability to integrate various AWS services (like S3 for storage, SES for email, etc.) seamlessly allows for building complex systems with minimal effort.
6. **DynamoDB Integration**:  
   DynamoDB provides a fully managed NoSQL database that scales automatically and offers high performance, making it a good choice for applications with variable workloads.

#### **Cons:**

1. **Cold Starts**:  
   Serverless functions can experience latency due to cold starts, particularly for infrequently used endpoints. This can lead to a slower response time for the first request.
2. **Complexity in Debugging and Monitoring**:  
   Troubleshooting and debugging can be more challenging in a serverless environment. It's harder to track down issues in distributed architectures, and traditional logging might not provide the same depth of information as a monolithic system.
3. **Vendor Lock-In**:  
   Using AWS and other cloud services can create dependencies on the vendor, making it more difficult to migrate to another cloud provider or back to a more traditional architecture.
4. **Limited Execution Time for Serverless Functions**:  
   AWS Lambda has a maximum execution time of 15 minutes, which may be a limitation for longer-running tasks. This can be mitigated by breaking down tasks, but still, it can add complexity.
5. **Cost Uncertainty**:  
   While serverless can be cost-effective at low traffic, heavy traffic or high-frequency invocations can sometimes lead to unexpected costs if not properly optimized.

### **Frontend: Next.js + Server Actions**

#### **Pros:**

1. **Full-Stack Capabilities**:  
   Next.js offers a powerful full-stack solution with built-in server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). Server Actions allow for seamless interaction between the frontend and backend, improving developer productivity.
2. **Faster Development**:  
   With Server Actions, Next.js enables you to write both frontend and backend code in the same file, reducing context switching and improving developer experience.
3. **Optimized Performance**:  
   Next.jsâ€™s hybrid rendering model, combining static generation, SSR, and client-side rendering, helps optimize page load times and overall performance.
4. **Easy Data Fetching**:  
   Server Actions in Next.js make it simple to fetch data on the server and pass it to the frontend, reducing client-side JavaScript overhead.
5. **Built-in Features**:  
   Next.js comes with built-in features like image optimization, API routes, and automatic static optimization, which help improve performance without needing to configure these features manually.

#### **Cons:**

1. **Learning Curve**:  
   Although Next.js is user-friendly, there may be a learning curve when integrating more advanced features like Server Actions or when transitioning from a traditional server-side framework.
2. **Overhead for Small Apps**:  
   Next.js offers a lot of functionality that may not be necessary for small, static websites. This can lead to unnecessary complexity and an increase in bundle size for minimal apps.
3. **Server Actions May Have Limitations**:  
   While Server Actions allow for backend logic in the frontend, this can introduce complexity in terms of data management and debugging, particularly in large applications.
4. **Dynamic Routing Overhead**:  
   Next.js's dynamic routing is powerful, but it can add some overhead, especially if there are many dynamic routes or if routes are not optimized properly.
5. **Increased Build Time for Large Apps**:  
   As the app grows, Next.js may experience slower build times due to the complexity of static generation, SSR, and other features that need to be processed at build time.

## **Future Improvements** (if time permits)

1. **Move XLSX to JSON Conversion**:  
   The XLSX to JSON conversion could be moved outside the serverless function. This would help reduce the computational load on the serverless function, improving performance when processing large files.

2. **Implement a Queue for DynamoDB Inserts**:  
   I would introduce a queue system for inserting objects into DynamoDB. This would allow for better management of data inserts, potentially reducing the response time of the function and optimizing throughput.
